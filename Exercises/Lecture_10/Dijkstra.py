"""
In the following code, the priority queue q contains pairs of the form (d, x),
meaning that the current distance to node x is d. The list distance contains the
distance to each node, and the list processed indicates whether a node has been
processed. Initially the distance is 0 to x and âˆž to all other nodes.
