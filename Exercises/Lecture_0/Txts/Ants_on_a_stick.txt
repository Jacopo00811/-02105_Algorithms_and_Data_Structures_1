The maximum duration of time before all ants have fallen off the stick over all possible initial placements of the ants is 100s. 
Since you can place the everywhere on the stick and they go at the same velocity, the max amount of time it will take them to fall on the
other side is 100s. (You can also imagine that the ants can cross each other)
