You have n zombies. You can make them duel in a cage 1 vs.1. You want to minimize the number of duels needed.

#### 6.1
If you want at most n-1 you can simply do a tournament of the type "King of the cage" where the winner zombie has to fight the next one.

#### 6.2
One approach to finding the strongest and weakest zombie in an army of n brainless zombies with at most 3n/2 duels is as follows:
Split the army into pairs of two zombies and determine the stronger one in each pair through a duel. This will result in n/2 stronger zombies.
Take the n/2 stronger zombies and split them into pairs again. Determine the stronger one in each pair through a duel. This will result in n/4 stronger zombies.
Repeat step 2 until there is only one zombie left. This zombie is the strongest zombie.
To find the weakest zombie, compare each of the defeated zombies in step 1 to the strongest zombie. The weakest zombie will 
be the one that lost in the duel against the strongest zombie. This approach will require at most 3n/2 duels, as the number 
of duels in each round is reduced by half.

#### 6.3
To find the strongest and the second strongest in at most n+log_2(n) duels you can do the following:
First do a normal tournament, the loosers of the tournament. Then take the looser of the final and make it duel with the loosers of the
other side of the bracket in order to establish if he is the second strongest or not. (These are other 4 duels). So in total we have:
7 duels form the normal tournament and 4 to establish the second strongest. 7+4=11 or generalized n+log_2(n) when n=8.
